"""One-command data refresh for the WebReg Course Planner.

Usage:  python3 scripts/refresh.py

Modern TSS opens the Schedule-of-Classes UI as a popup we can't drive, so we
DON'T browse it. Instead we log in once, then read the class data straight
from its backing OData v4 service with the session cookies. You just log in
and close the window — the script does the rest.

The ONLY manual step is the login itself: a REAL browser opens, you do UCSD
SSO + Duo, and the script takes over the instant a session appears — you do
NOT need to browse anywhere or even close the window. Everything before and
after the login is automated.

Steps:
  1. tss/connect.py — launched in the background; a REAL browser opens. You log
     in with UCSD SSO + Duo and stop there. The script polls tss/state.json and
     resumes the moment a live SAP session is captured.
  2. tss/fetch_soc.py — pulls the full FA26 catalog + events directly from the
     yucsd_con_module OData service using the session you just created.
     -> data/tss_fa26/{modules,events}.json
  3. tss/import_fa26.py — maps the dumps into data/parsed/FA26/<DEPT>.json.
  4. Stamps today's date into data/refreshed_at.txt (the site's "Data as of").
  5. scripts/build_site.py — seed -> export -> rebuild site/.

It does NOT touch git. When Claude runs this for you it reviews the result,
commits it to the `staging` branch, and pushes the PREVIEW deploy — the live
site (main) is only updated when you say "ship".
